# Roost_Controller


Scenario:
You've just been moved to the R&D department of Roost, an IoT company that is interested in
building a smart thermostat. It is your job to produce a prototype of the firmware that will drive
the device. At a minimum, your implementation must accept a user-requested temperature and
attempt to bring the temperature of the house to that temperature. Unfortunately, since the
project is still early in development, none of the hardware has been completed, so you'll have to
test your controller in a simulated environment.

The controller must be safe thus the AC and the heater units should not overheat and should be given enough time to cool down and they both should not be on at the same time. In addition, The controller must be effecient.

To find documentation on the code and how the controller was implmented please read WriteUp.docx
